Hey, I'm Alek. I like to write code.
I usually code in TypeScript for a living, but I'm having a little suare with Rust at the moment.
Completely switched over to NVim for my development needs in the past month.
If there was a word to describe feeling ascended, that's what I'd write the switch to Rust+NVim from TypeScript+VSCode is.

Listed below are some of my (worst) best repos.

In my spare time I like to fight and watch people fight.
