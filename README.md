Hey, I'm Alek. I'm Head of Eng @ Pabau. I code and do code related things.

Systems design, architecture, infra and all that jazz.

Go, Rust, Typescript are my gotos atm (pun intended).

As I grow older I've learned to love a strict type system, memory management and low level control.

Building good UIs is easy.

Listed below are some of my (worst) best repos.

In my spare time I like to punch heavy bags, watch people fight and... as sad as it is, code more.
